This repository contains a number of learning models that I've implemented for cross-
situational word learning research. I am slowly trying to collect implementations 
from over the years (along with data), so please bear with me as I standardize and 
document functions. Most of these models and data have appeared in at least one of my 
publications, which can all be found on my website: http://www.kachergis.com

Please let me know if you have any questions, or if you have found this collection
useful please cite my dissertation.
